# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [postfix-macros](https://github.com/est31/postfix-macros), a clever hack to allow postfix macros in stable Rust.

Thanks to [Willi Kappler](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/841) for the suggestion!

## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

* [2020-11-10](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-10.md):
1 Regression, 2 Improvements, 2 mixed

A mixed week with improvements still outweighing regressions. Perhaps the biggest highlight was the move to compiling rustc crates [with the initial-exec TLS model](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78201) which results in fewer calls to `_tls_get_addr` and thus faster compile times.

See the [full report](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/triage/2020-11-10.md) for more.

## Approved RFCs
